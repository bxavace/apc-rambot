# FOREWORD

It is a pleasure to welcome you to Asia Pacific College (APC)\!

APC is passionate in upholding our core values of industry, integrity,
and innovation. With a great sense of commitment, we intend to instill
these core values in each of our student.

We believe that the aspirational character of our graduates has
continuously proven the legacy of its founders, SM Foundation and IBM
Philippines. They have also strengthened our institutional foundation
since its establishment.

As you embark in higher learning, it is our hope that we will be
instrumental to your character formation which will be brought about by
the following guiding principles and values:

**INDUSTRY.** Taking pride in “bridging the gap between the academe and
the industry,” APC prepares you to be industry-ready. Equipped with what
the industry needs, we breed and groom a new generation of professionals
who are capable of being at their best at what they do. Our battle cry
states, “Real projects. Real learning.” All of these happen as you are
not only mentored by academicians, but also by industry practitioners
and experts in their respective fields.

**INTEGRITY.** As an APCian, we know that integrity takes more than just
form, but it also concerns itself with substance. Our graduates bring
with them an unquestionable character that is well-grounded and
strengthened with life principles that can never be compromised.

**INNOVATION.** Being lifelong learners is what APC graduates are all
about. This value gives you the edge of always being ahead of your
league, never being complacent nor satisfied with what can be learned
now, but constantly striving to learn new things each time a challenge
is presented.

Now is the time to take on the challenge of higher learning through
Senior High School and Degree Programs. Our Student Handbook will serve
as a guide for you to get to know the institution, its policies, rules
and regulation, your rights, privileges, and many other things that will
transform you into a true APCian.

Finally, we enjoin you to live and breathe the fresh air of learning at
its best\!

**MA. TERESITA P. MEDADO**

President

Asia Pacific College

## HISTORY

It was the dawning of Information Technology (IT) so IBM Philippines
wanted to encourage IT development in the country and help in addressing
the dearth of competent IT-professionals who are qualified to serve the
industry. Thus, in 1991, then IBM Philippines Chairman and General
Manager Ramon Dimacali approached the SM Group Chairman, Mr. Henry Sy
Sr., to explore the possibility of establishing a learning institution
to hone skilled IT professionals for the industry. SM responded by
committing the resources of SM Foundation which, at that time, had been
supporting a few hundred scholars in selected colleges and universities.
On the other hand, IBM Philippines committed its world-renowned IBM
technology.

Mr. Sy and Mr. Dimacali, together with then EVP of De La Salle
University (DLSU) and SM I.T. Consultant, Dr. Paulino Y. Tan, along with
Prof. Leonida Africa, then VP of the Philippine Accrediting Association
of Schools, Colleges, and Universities (PAASCU) and former DLSU-VP for
Academic Programs, and Bro. Andrew Gonzales, FSC, former President of
DLSU, spearheaded the talks for the proposed venture. By the end of
1991, the partnership between IBM and SM Foundation was finalized and
Asia Pacific College (APC) was established.

Initially, APC’s first students were employees of various corporations
who needed to update their I.T. skills and know-how. By 1994, APC
launched its School of Information Technology (IT) and accepted its
first batch of degree program students. And the rest, as they say, is
history.

Today, APC consists of Senior High School (Grades 11 and 12) and four
schools for undergraduate studies, namely School of Computing and
Information Technologies (SoCIT), School of Engineering (SoE), School of
Management (SoM), School of Multimedia and Arts (SoMA), and a Graduate
School offering Master’s programs on Information Technology, Information
Systems, and Management.

# VISION

Asia Pacific College envisions itself to be the preferred Higher
Education Institution that bridges the academe with the industry through
its programs that are founded on IT-based concepts and applications,
guided by the core values of integrity, industry, and innovation that
works.

# MISSION

Asia Pacific College, powered by education, a balanced curriculum, and
industry professionals as its faculty, aims to provide the business and
information and communications technology industry, both in the
Philippines and in the global community, with lifelong learning
graduates who are anchored on the principles of integrity and
professionalism.

# VALUES

APC aims to produce graduates with a strong sense of **industry** or
hard work, **integrity** or honesty that is coupled with strong
moral/ethical principles, and **innovation** or the consistent
introduction of new and creative methods or ideas.

The student should fill out the form and submit it to the Logistics
Office for approval at least one (1) day before the scheduled trip.

To avail of the shuttle service, the passenger must present the approved

children should always be accompanied by adults. They will be allowed
only in designated areas and/or offices. Pets are not allowed inside the
building premises.

## Ingress & Egress

  - Everyone must present their bags for inspection by the guards.

#### 2.4. CREDIT AND GRADING SYSTEM

##### 2.4.1. Senior High School

The program assigns specific subjects each term which should be taken by
the students. No more than the prescribed number of subjects are
allowed.

The Senior High School Program adopts the prescribed grading system of
the Department of Education (DepEd). Students’ grades are computed
differently according to subject categories, such as the following:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Grade Components</th>
<th>
<p>CORE Subjects</p>
</th>
<th>Academic Track</th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td><p>All other</p>
<p>Subjects</p>
<p>(Applied and</p>
<p>Specialized)</p></td>
<td><p>Work Immersion/</p>
<p>Culminating</p>
<p>Activity</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Written Work</td>
<td>25%</td>
<td>25%</td>
<td>35%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Performance Tasks</td>
<td>50%</td>
<td>45%</td>
<td>40%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Quarterly</p>
<p>Assessment</p></td>
<td>25%</td>
<td>30%</td>
<td>25%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The final grades of students in each subject per term are described as
follows:

| **Descriptors**           | **Grading Scale** | **Remarks** |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| Outstanding               | 90 - 100          | Passed      |
| Very Satisfactory         | 85 - 89           | Passed      |
| Satisfactory              | 80 - 84           | Passed      |
| Fairly Satisfactory       | 75 - 79           | Passed      |
| Did Not Meet Expectations | Below 75          | Failed      |

A student who did not meet the expected passing grade will be required
to go through the Remediation Program. Failure in the remedial class
would require the student to repeat the subject, resulting to a delay in
time of graduation.

##### 2.4.2. College

Each program has a prescribed minimum number of academic units. In
general, every credit unit requires 80 minutes of attendance each day.
Thus, a course requiring four hours of attendance per week carries a 3
units of credit.

Undergraduate transferee students may be allowed to have courses taken
from their previous college be credited within the first school year of
enrollment, subject to evaluation and approval of the Executive
Director.

The College adopts the numerical grading system. Table 2.1 shows the
transmutation of grade points, corresponding descriptions, and
equivalences to other schools:

A grade of 0.0 (or failed) is given to students who have incurred
absences more than the required limit as stipulated in Section 4.1.9 of
this handbook. This grade cannot be changed into an A.W. if the student
officially withdraws after the deadline of submission of midterms
grades. An irrevocable grade of 0.0 (or failed) is given to students who
are caught cheating as per Section

4.2.6 of this Student Handbook.

A student can appeal for a change of grade only until the end of the
term, immediately succeeding the term when the subject had been
enrolled. For instance, a student can only request for a change of grade
in PHYSIC1, a subject taken during the 1st term, until the end of the
2nd term of the same school year.

The trimestral or cumulative GPA is computed as follows (see tables for
samples):

  - For each subject taken, multiply the credit units by the
    corresponding grade earned (except those with “R” or “Repeat” as the
    final grade). The resulting product is the honor point earned for
    the course.

  - Evaluate the sum of the honor points earned.

  - For the obtained honor points, divide it by the total number of
    credit units for the subjects taken (except those with a final grade
    of “R”). The quotient is the student’s GPA for the trimester (if the
    subjects considered were those taken in one trimester only), or the
    Cumulative GPA (if the computations considered all subjects).

  - Indices are computed to four decimal places rounded off to two.

The formula representing this computation is as follows:

GPA = <span class="underline">(H<sub>1</sub+ H<sub>2</sub+ … +
H<sub>n</sub>)</span>

(U<sub>1</sub+ U<sub>2</sub+ … + U<sub>n</sub>)

where

H = honor points

n = total number of courses U = credit units

## Guidelines for Borrowing and Returning of IT Equipment

1.  Borrowing of computer or multimedia equipment is on a first come,
    first served basis depending on availability. Equipment may be
    borrowed for a maximum of four (4) hours per week by an individual
    or identified group. To ensure equipment allocation, students are
    advised to fill out the IT Equipment Borrowing Form to reserve the
    equipment that they need to borrow at least two days in advance
    (excluding Sundays and holidays). Priority will always be given to
    class use. Reserved equipment are to be picked up and returned on
    time.
    
    1.  Reserved equipment not picked-up within 30 minutes of the agreed
        pick-up time may be:

Lent to other borrowers, and

Current borrower shall be penalized accordingly unless the reservation
is cancelled one (1) hour and forty-five (45) minutes before the
pick-up time.

2.  Borrowed equipment not returned on time will be penalized
    accordingly. (See penalty rate in the Borrower’s Form)

3.  Students with outstanding balance due to unpaid penalty may not be
    lent equipment unless outstanding balance is fully paid.

<!-- end list -->

2.  Because some APC Audio/Visual equipment are expensive, the ITRO
    reserves the right to substitute suitably-capable equipment before
    they are reserved to manage borrower’s expectations. Substitution of
    equipment are normally decided on factors like:
    
    1.  A class schedule exists on the intended borrowing date.
    
    2.  Borrower does not have prior knowledge in the proper handling of
        the equipment to be borrowed.
    
    3.  The purpose for borrowing a particular equipment can be
        satisfied by another set of equipment.
    
    4.  The safety of the location where the equipment will be used is
        questionable.
    
    5.  Other reasons deemed valid by ITRO Audio/Visual custodians and
        staff.

3.  The borrower has full responsibility for the equipment. Equipment
    are to be returned in the same condition as they were borrowed. Any
    damage or loss will have to be replaced or paid for. The school
    reserves the right to demand a replacement or the cost of the
    replacement in case the equipment in question is damaged beyond
    repair. Likewise, the borrower is fully responsible for all data
    indicated in the borrower’s form. Any misrepresentation or false
    entry will be considered as a major offense offense as stated in
    this Student Handbook and shall be dealt in accordance with Student
    Handbook guidelines.

4.  As a disciplinary measure, penalties (see Penalty Matrix) will be
    levied on students who fail to return borrowed equipment on time.
    Proper courtesy to the next borrower should always be observed.

5.  Equipment to be returned after the school’s normal operating hours
    may be turned over to the school guard at the lobby for safekeeping.
    Borrowers, however, are to retrieve these equipment from the guard
    and return these personally to the ITRO immediately within the
    office hours of the following day for checking and appropriate
    storage. The penalty clock will not stop until all of the borrowed
    equipment are returned and checked for damages.

6.  The penalty timer runs from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., Monday through
    Friday, and 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Saturday. Outside the penalty
    timer’s period, a flat rate of P250 per equipment per weeknight and
    P500 per equipment for the whole weekend will be charged if the
    equipment is not returned to the IT Resources Office.

### II. Counseling

The counselor assists the students in meeting and resolving conflict,
identifying and preventing difficulties, remedying appropriate
adjustments, and developing potential through individual counseling,
group procedures, and consultation with parents and teachers. Each
counseling experience is geared toward the following:

1.  Facilitating changes in the behavior of students

2.  Improving social and personal relationships

3.  Motivating students to assume responsibility in school and at home
    
      - ***Individual counseling*** serves as a means for students to
        express their thoughts and feelings toward their friends,
        classmates, teachers, and family, and to their share
        experiences.
    
      - ***Academic counseling/monitoring*** is conducted to monitor the
        student’s academic performance. Counseling also provides a venue
        for airing academic concerns.
    
      - ***Disciplinary counseling/monitoring*** is administered to
        students referred by the Discipline Office.
    
      - ***Personal counseling*** is conducted for students to become
        objective and for them to develop a positive attitude when
        handling personal problems. The guidance counselor provides a
        confidential atmosphere in which students can explore any topic
        or situation and discuss any concern that they may have.
        Students are taught to work through their problems, to develop
        self-awareness, and to overcome problems by using new coping
        strategies.
    
      - ***Group counseling*** facilitates small group discussions
        involving students with common problems and concerns. Small
        group counseling may be scheduled to cover topics in different
        areas; namely health, behavior, academics, and related cases.
    
      - ***Follow-up counseling/monitoring*** is done to monitor and
        determine the coping skills of students who had gone through
        counseling.

## Consultations

The Guidance Counselors/Associates conduct consultations with teachers
to find significant data about a student’s behavior both inside and
outside the classroom. Teachers also confer with the counselor
concerning students who are under academic probation.

Parent-counselor conferences are held to discuss student behavioral
problems, adjustment problems, academic difficulties, and the academic
contract.

## Research

The Guidance Counselors, Associates, and Psychometrician conduct
research through surveys, interviews, and psychological test results to
help them determine various issues and concerns among students and
various areas of the College that need intervention. These researches
are bases for guidance program design, projects, and activities.

## Testing

Psychological tests are conducted to help students understand their
uniqueness, strengths, limitations, and potentials. The results of these
tests assist the guidance counselors/associates in the
counseling/monitoring process and help them design interventions to
address the needs of students.

## XIII. CAMPUS MINISTRY

name is not in the official class list.

4.1.3 Students are considered late if they arrive within the allowable
period as prescribed below:

25 minutes for an 80-minute class session

40 minutes for a 120-minute class session

their instructor.

4.1.5 A student is held responsible for all course requirements and
content of the sessions missed, regardless of the reasons for his/ her
absences.

4.1.6 There are no excused absences. Twenty percent (20%) of all class

Thus, the maximum number of absences is as follows:

2.5 for classes meeting once a week

5.0 for classes meeting twice a week

7.5 for classes meeting thrice a week

For Associate in Computer Technology IT subjects:

3 for classes with duration of 10 meetings or less

4.1.7 Absences of honor students will not be counted against them except
for major examination schedules. However, they are expected to be
responsible for whatever they will miss in class. They are still
required to submit and take exams as scheduled.

4.1.8 If the instructor does not arrive on the first “third” of the
total class time, the class representative should seek confirmation on
the instructor’s unavailability from the reception staff at the 4th
floor. If a student leaves before the said confirmation and the
instructor (or substitute) arrives thereafter, the student may be marked
absent for the particular session.

4.1.9 A student who has incurred numerous absences will report to the
Guidance Counselor.

### 4.2 Attendance for Senior High School Students

4.2.1 An officially enrolled student is considered late if he comes

Three counts of coming to class late is equivalent to one absence.

session without the expressed permission of his/her instructor is
considered to be cutting classes. Thus, he is subject to disciplinary
action.

4.2.4 There are no excused absences. Absences due to emergency reasons
should be supported by an excuse letter or proof of records stating the
reason of absences (e.g., medical certificate). The maximum number of

or 16 days per term.

4.2.5 A student who incurs absences that are more than 20% of the total
number of school days in a term shall get a failing grade of 70 for
specific subjects. The student then will be disqualified from the

may require the student to submit a formal complaint. The Executive
Director/Director for Senior High School may also require the
concerned faculty/staff to answer the complaint in writing. Failure of
the respondent to provide a written response within the required

Director/Director for Senior High School shall resolve the complaint
based on the strength of this admission.

The complaint should be resolved by the Executive Director/ Director
for Senior High School at the soonest possible time. For formal
resolutions, original copies should be provided to the department,

be carried out to ensure fairness and objectivity. Resolution will be
done at the soonest possible time. It will not take more than one week
from the start of the appeal. The decision of the Grievance Board is
executory unless appealed to the President.

In cases that the complaint is against the Student Affairs Director,
appeals will be made to the Human Resources Executive Director who,
upon verifying the merit of the case, may convene the Grievance Board
composed of the following people:

  - Two (2) Executive Directors not involved with the case

7.0 **Discipline Matters**

### 7.1 Disciplinary Action and Procedures

Disciplinary actions are corrective measures imposed upon by the
college administration on students who have violated the rules and
regulations of the school. The imposed sanctions should not be cruel
or physically harmful in nature.

The college has a shared responsibility to shape the character of its
students and help them become ethical and socially responsible
individuals and members of society.

The disciplinary action and sanctions imposed on erring students are
tools to compel them to observe the norms of conduct, whether
on-campus or off-campus, as expected of members of the academic
community.

The Discipline Office is tasked with the implementation of school
policies and regulations concerning student behavior and conduct. A
Discipline Head is mandated by the college to carry out the policies
and procedures required to maintain peace and discipline among
students.

The College shall have the right to promulgate reasonable norms,
rules, and regulations as it may deem necessary. This must be

consistent and in accordance with the minimum standards as provided by
CHED regulations and the Philippine law.

A student’s liability shall not be confined to the offenses
specifically identified and defined in the school’s rules or code of
discipline. Several offenses may be generally worded as to encompass a
number of related wrongdoings. Such rules and regulations shall be
made effective upon its promulgation via an appropriate school
issuance or publication (See Section 103, Authority to Promulgate
Institutional Policies, Rules and Regulations; Manual of Regulation
for Private Schools).

### 7.2 Disciplinary Due Process

It is the right of the school to impose disciplinary actions and
corresponding sanctions on students who are found to be violating
rules and regulations as specified and contained in this student
handbook.

In exercising its right, it is the duty and responsibility of the
school to provide due process to both violator and complainant, so as
to ensure fairness and objectivity in the carrying out and imposing or
implementing school policies. The student respondent is to be given
opportunities to explain, contest, and present evidence within
reasonable time to answer the charges against his/her actions. This in
accordance with the minimum standards of due process as provided by
CHED regulations and the Philippine law.

In cases wherein the student is accused of the commission of major
offenses and upon having a minimum recommended sanction of
dismissal/exclusion, non-readmission, or expulsion from the Discipline
Office:

1.  The student must be informed via e-mail or Teams chat of the nature
    and cause of any of the accusation against him. The student is given
    5 business days to reply (either via e-mail, MS Teams chat, or in
    person). Failure to reply within the specified number of days will
    be considered an admission of guilt.

2.  If the student is a minor, the parent or guardian shall be furnished
    with a copy of the show cause (disciplinary inquiry) letter.

3.  If the student denies the accusation or alleges some fact or matter
    in justification or mitigation of the offense, the institution shall
    form a fact-finding committee (Discipline Board) to hear and receive
    evidence.

The Discipline Board is composed of:

1.  APC President

2.  Executive Director/Directors

3.  Guidance Office Head D. Discipline Office Head

E. Selected Faculty Members

4.  In all stages of the proceedings, the student shall have the right
    receive the assistance of his chosen counsel (Discipline Board
    notification to parents/guardians).

5.  The student shall have the right to be listened to. The evidence
    presented against him should be examined. The student shall also
    have the right to ask clarificatory questions through a fact-finding
    committee and to present evidence on his behalf.

6.  The fact-finding committee must consider and receive the pieces of
    evidence presented during the proceedings (Discipline Board
    hearing).

7.  The student shall be informed in writing of the decision promulgated
    in his case.

8.  If the student is found culpable for the offense charged, the
    punishment imposed by the Discipline Board shall be commensurate
    with the nature and gravity of the offense.

The minimum sanction for major offenses is suspension for no less than
five (5) days or up to twenty percent (20%) of the prescribed total
class days for the school term. The maximum sanction to be imposed is
dismissal/exclusion, non-readmission, or expulsion (for offenses or
acts that involve moral turpitude or constituting gross misconduct,
which are considered as criminal, pursuant to existing penal laws).

Major Offenses that are to be sanctioned with the maximum penalty of
dismissal/exclusion, non-readmission, or expulsion shall be thoroughly
investigated and decided upon by the College Discipline Board composed
of five members from the administration and faculty who are duly
appointed by the President of the College. Other major offenses that
have a recommended sanction of suspension shall be decided upon and
implemented by the Discipline Head.

This is in accordance with the provisions in the Manual of Regulations
for Private Schools (Section 106, Preventive Suspension and Categories
of Administrative Penalties).

## Preventive Suspension

A student under investigation may be preventively suspended from
entering school premises and from attending classes when the evidence
of guilt is strong. This is also done when the responsible school
official is morally convinced that the continued stay of the student
would cause sufficient distraction to the normal operations of the
institution, or would pose real or imminent threat or danger to people
or property inside the institution’s premises.

## Suspension

This is a sanction where the college deprives or denies the erring
student from attending classes for a period not exceeding twenty
percent (20%) of the prescribed total class days for the school term.
The erring student will be required to render student assistant (SA)
duties for the duration of the suspension.

## Non-Readmission

**7.3 List of Offenses**

This is a sanction that allows the college to deny admission or
enrollment of an erring student for the school term immediately
following the term when the resolution or decision regarding the
student being guilty of the offense is charged against him/her, and
when the imposition of the sanction of non-readmission was
promulgated. Unlike the penalty of dismissal/exclusion, the student is
allowed to complete the current school term when the resolution for
non-readmission was promulgated. Transfer credentials shall be issued
upon promulgation. This is subject to the provisions of the current
Manual of Regulations for Private Schools.

## Dismissal/Exclusion

This is a sanction that allows the college to exclude/dismiss the name
of the erring student from the roll of students immediately upon the
promulgation of the resolution for dismissal/ exclusion.

The college shall preserve a complete record of the proceedings for a
period of one (1) year in order to afford the Commission on Higher
Education (for college) and Department of Education (for SHS) with
time to review the case in the event that the student files and
appeals with CHED or DepEd.

## Expulsion

This is a sanction wherein the college declares an erring student to
be disqualified for admission to any public or private higher
education institution in the Philippines. In any case, the penalty of
expulsion cannot be imposed without the approval of the Chairman of
the Commission on Higher Education (for college) and Secretary of the
Deparment of Education (for SHS).

This sanction may be imposed (for offenses or acts that involve moral
turpitude or constitute gross misconduct, which are considered as
criminal and pursuant to existing penal laws).

The institution shall forward a complete record of the proceedings to
the CHED Regional Office (for college) or DepEd Regional Office (for
SHS) concerned within ten (10) days from the termination of the
investigation of each case.

## Appeals

**7.4 Major Offenses**

Sanctions imposed on students by the Discipline Head or the Discipline
Board may be appealed for in writing through the Office of the
Director for Student Affairs within three (3) days after the student
has received the promulgated sanction from either the Discipline
Office or the Discipline Board.

Once the Director for Student Affairs (SA) receives a written appeal
from a student, the Director will then convene a committee composed of
three members (including the SA Director as Chair and two Executive
Directors as members, one of which should be the Executive Director of
the student concerned).

The committee may call upon faculty, school administrators, students,
and staff as resource persons during the review and deliberation of
each case.

Decisions of the Appeals Committee are considered final.

The College reserves the right to drop, dismiss/exclude, non-readmit,
impose expulsion, suspend, or impose other sanctions that it may deem
necessary, consistent, and in accordance with the minimum standards as
provided by CHED regulations and the Philippine law; or suspend a
student at any time if found, after due investigation of the
discipline board, to have seriously violated the rules and regulations
of the College.

## Disciplinary Sanctions for Major Offenses

Depending on the gravity of the incident, the following major offenses
will merit its corresponding penalties:

1.  Written warning from the Discipline Head (in the form of a letter or
    a violation slip)

2.  Written reprimand from the Discipline Head upon conference with the
    parent/guardian of the student

3.  Disciplinary probation for such time and under such conditions as
    the Discipline Head or Director for Student Affairs may determine,
    with heavier sanction as the Discipline Head or Director for Student
    Affairs may determine if any condition of the probation is violated

4.  Student Assistant/Community Service

5.  Counseling Sessions with the Guidance Office

6.  Suspension for such time and under such conditions as the Discipline
    Head or Director for Student Affairs may determine

7.  Dismissal/Exclusion

8.  Non-readmission

9.  Expulsion

10. Penalties will be determined by the Discipline Head after careful
    evaluation, not only of the nature of the act, but also of the
    circumstances surrounding it.

### 7.6 Disciplinary Clearance and Hold Orders

The Discipline Head or the Director for Student Affairs may disallow
students to proceed with enrollment, transfer, or graduation if they
have unresolved disciplinary cases or incompletely carried out
sanctions.

### 8.0 Drug Testing Program Implementing Guidelines

This is in accordance with the pertinent provisions of Republic Act No.
7722, otherwise known as the “Higher Education Act of 1994,” and
pursuant to Section 36c of Article III (R.A. 9165), otherwise known as
the “Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.”

#### Purpose of the Program 

The primary responsibility of APC is to provide good education to our
students under a safe, secure, and peaceful school environment. It is
the College’s endeavor to ensure that our students and staff are
protected from the harm and threats prevailing in society, particularly
the threat caused by dangerous drugs.

A program of deterrence is instituted as a proactive approach to a
drug-free school. Collaboration between members of the entire college,
parents, and the community is critical to this prevention effort.

The purpose of this program is:

1.  To oversee the health and safety of every student

2.  To determine the prevalence of drug users among students

3.  To assess the effectiveness of college-based and community-based
    prevention programs

4.  To undermine the effects of peer pressure by providing a legitimate
    reason for students to refuse/deter the use of illegal drugs

5.  To encourage students who use drugs to participate in drug treatment
    and rehabilitation programs, and

6.  To strengthen the collaboration efforts of identified agencies
    against the use of illegal drugs and the rehabilitation of drug
    users and dependents

#### General Guidelines

As an integral part of the Drug Prevention Program of Asia Pacific
College, these guidelines represent one component in a college-wide
effort to respond effectively to drug and mood-altering
substance-related situations that may occur in the campus or at
college-sponsored activities. These are intended to provide minimum and
consistent disciplinary means to respond to related incidents. APC will
provide a safe and healthy environment for students with due
consideration of their legal rights and responsibilities.

As an extension of this policy, all college personnel, when responding
to drug and mood-altering substances, as well as alcohol-related
situations, should use the following rules, regulations, and guidelines:

  - No person may possess, use, produce, sell, distribute, or aid in the
    distribution of alcohol, narcotics, drugs, mood-altering substances
    and the like, nor use, possess, sell, or distribute paraphernalia
    for the purpose of drug use at any time in the school buildings, on
    the school property and grounds, in college-sponsored vehicles, or
    at college-sponsored events at other sites.

  - The terms “alcoholic, narcotics, drugs, mood-altering substances and
    the like” refer to items such as the following: gases, solvents,
    butane, propane, adhesives; marijuana or its derivatives; cocaine
    /crack; LSD or other hallucinogenic drugs; barbiturates; PCP;
    amphetamines and amphetamine-like compounds; heroin, methadone;
    scheduled narcotics; steroids; herbal/natural euphoria; look-alike
    products; and any substances commonly referred to as illegal drugs
    by R.A. 9165.

  - The unauthorized, inappropriate, and/or illegal use of prescription
    and over-the-counter preparations is prohibited. Prescription
    medication or over-the-counter preparations for personal use shall
    be allowed only with written orders from a physician. Laws shall
    apply.

## DRUG TESTING GUIDELINES

1.  All new students shall submit themselves to the baseline drug
    testing procedures of the school. All students and their parents are
    notified in writing on the process and manner of the random drug
    testing activity. Random drug tests will be conducted anytime during
    the students’ stay in the College.

2.  The selection process for random drug testing is computerized. It
    can also be done in any manner that shall be agreed upon by the Drug
    Testing Head.

3.  Prior to testing, the selected students shall be asked to reveal the
    prescription medicines, vitamins, and food supplements that they

had ingested within the past five (5) days. The APC-DOH-accredited
laboratory who will conduct the test shall keep the listing and
utilize this in the evaluation of the confirmatory drug test.

4.  The laboratory shall follow the DOH prescribed guidelines in the
    collection of urine specimens. Universal precautions shall be
    observed at all times. DOH prescribed guidelines shall be posted in
    strategic places/visible areas of the school.

5.  ![](media/image11.png)The monitoring personnel assigned to ensure
    the integrity of the collection process should be of the same sex as
    the student taking the test.

6.  Students randomly chosen or those who are scheduled to take the
    baseline drug test but are not able to participate in the scheduled
    testing will be required by the school to proceed to the
    APC-accredited service provider and submit themselves to the
    procedure within a prescribed period.

7.  Students who fail to comply with the required testing within the
    prescribed period will be subjected to administrative and
    disciplinary action for “insubordination,” which is categorized as a
    major offense as stated in the APC Student Handbook.

## TREATMENT OF POSITIVE DRUG TEST RESULTS 

1.  The results of the test are strictly confidential. The laboratory
    shall place the drug test result in a sealed envelope and deliver
    the same via personal service to the Drug Testing Coordinator of the
    school.

2.  In case the test results are confirmed positive, the Drug Testing
    Head shall invite both the student and parent for a conference.
    During the scheduled conference, the Drug Testing Coordinator shall
    relay to the student and parent the result of the test and will aim
    to identify problems or reasons that may need professional help.
    Discussion and explanation of the diagnostic process (or ruling out
    drug dependence) will also take place. Prior to this scheduled
    conference, review of any present illnesses, problems, or medical
    history of the student will be done (if data is available),
    including the academic performance of the student.

3.  First-time positive confirmatory drug test results shall not be
    grounds for expulsion or any disciplinary action against the
    student.

4.  Students who will be confirmed positive will be required to
    undertake Drug Dependency Assessment (DDA) in the APC–DOH-accredited
    laboratory to identify the dependency level and to identify if the
    student is a Dependent User (DU) or Recreational User (RU). This
    assessment is at the expense of the student.

5.  In the event that it is determined that the student is
    drug-dependent, the DOH-accredited facility or physician may make a
    recommendation to the student, parent, and Drug Testing Head to have
    the student referred to a DOH-accredited facility suited to the
    student’s level of dependency.

The parent and student may choose to enroll the student in a private
rehabilitation center or program or opt to avail of the rehabilitation
services of the government through a DOH-accredited facility.

If the parents refuse to act, the school shall proceed in accordance
with Section 61 of R.A. 9165 without prejudice to the provision of
Section 73 of R.A. 9165.

At this time, the student will be taking a leave of absence and will
be allowed to re-enroll if the student is later on found to have been
rehabilitated. Once allowed to enroll, the student will be under the
school monitoring phase for a year.

6.  Students who will be found only as Recreational Users, as per the
    DDA result, will be under the school monitoring phase for a year.

During this phase, a maximum of six (6) drug tests at the expense of
the student shall be conducted (still randomly chosen, catching
students off-guard). A process of observation and counseling during
this phase shall be done in coordination with the parent and the Drug
Counselor of the school.

7.  In the event that the student is confirmed positive for any
    dangerous drugs in the confirmatory drug test result while in the
    **monitoring phase**, the student may merit dismissal from the
    college.

8.  If all the student’s random drug tests are clean after the one-year
    monitoring period, then he/she shall be removed from the monitoring
    list. His/her status after the monitoring phase shall be the same as
    any regular student who can still be randomly chosen from the whole
    student population for a drug test. If the student is found
    positive, the student has to undergo the same assessment.

### Enforcement of Compliance

Students who refuse to undergo random testing and baseline testing shall
be required to explain in writing his/her reasons for refusal. If the
student’s given reasons are determined to be without merit by the drug
assessment board of the college, the student shall be required to comply
with the college directive. Noncompliance shall then be regarded as
insubordination in accordance with the policies and regulations of the
college.

        individual or in granting said individual favorable
        compensation, terms, conditions, promotions, or privileges; or
        the refusal to grant the sexual favor results in the limiting,

        or considerations; or
    
    4.  When the sexual advances result in an intimidating, hostile or
        offensive environment for the student, trainee or apprentice.

Any person who directs or induces another to commit any act of sexual
harassment as herein defined, or who cooperates in the commission
thereof by another without which it would not have been committed,

concerned.

**SEC. 5.**

Liability of the Employer, Head of Office, Educational or Training
Institution. - The employer or head of office, educational or training

Be enacted by Senate and House of Representatives of the Philippines in
Congress assembled:

**SEC. 1.**

Hazing, as used in this Act, is an initiation rite or practice as a

    professional institutions where such use is in the public interest

    in a place where no admission fee is charged in respect of such
    public performance or communication, by a club or institution for
    charitable or educational purpose only, whose aim is not profit
    making, subject to such other limitations as may be provided in the

rehabilitation in the same style as the original of a building to which

the work by reprographic reproduction:

1.  Where the works by reason of its fragile character or rarity cannot
    be lent to user in its original form;

2.  Where the works are isolated articles contained in composite works
    or brief portions of other published works and the reproduction is
    necessary to supply them, when this is considered expedient, to
    persons requesting their loan for purposes of research or study
    instead of lending the volumes or booklets which contain them; and

3.  Where the making of such a copy is in order to preserve and, if
    necessary in the event that it is lost, destroyed or rendered
    unusable, replace a copy, or to replace, in the permanent collection
    of another similar library or archive, a copy which has been lost,
    destroyed or rendered unusable and copies are not available with the
    publisher.

188.2. Notwithstanding the above provisions, it shall not be
permissible to produce a volume of a work published in several volumes
or to produce missing tomes or pages of magazines or similar works,
unless the volume, tome or part is out of stock. Provided, That every
library which, by law, is entitled to receive copies of a printed
work, shall be entitled, when special reasons so require, to reproduce

collection of the library but which is out of stock. (Sec. 13, P. D.
49a)

computer program: Provided, That the copy or adaptation is necessary
for:

1.  The use of the computer program in conjunction with a computer for
    the purpose, and to the extent, for which the computer program has
    been obtained; and

## APPENDIX F - HOME STUDY GUIDELINES

### Finding Ways to Enable and Support Home Study 

There are no right or wrong educational solutions at this time of
crisis. There is only hope and confidence that our students are groomed
for continuous learning beyond the school environment. Innovation in
teaching and learning is our key solution. We believe that we can
quickly reinvent our ways of providing the quality education that you
deserve in spite of this unprecedented and prolonged crisis.

**What is Home Study?**

Asia Pacific College (APC) defines “Home Study” as a course or courses
carried out at home or any such safe and conducive learning environment.
How does APC implement and support Home Study?

1.  Lessons are created and contained in the “APC CoursePacks”, a
    digital repository of learning resources, prescribed learning
    activities, assignments, as well as assessment, which are not
    necessarily tests.

2.  Conduct of lessons are remotely supervised, monitored, and assessed
    by APC Faculty.

3.  Students may study at their own pace, but mindful of the schedules
    imposed by teachers such as submission deadlines for assignments and
    projects, and assessment.

4.  At the end of the term, students in each course/class will be given
    grades, approximating their performance and participation.

**What are APC CoursePacks?**

Your hardworking teachers are happy to present for your use APC’s latest
innovation in teaching and learning during Home Study. The APC
CoursePacks:

1.  A digital collection of assigned readings and other related
    references covering the course syllabi.

2.  A collection of activities, assignments, and assessment intended to
    help you enhance learning and achieve the expected learning outcomes
    which can be accomplished in a Home Study environment, mindful and
    considerate of certain limitations that our current social
    conditions may impose.

**How do you gain access to the APC CoursePacks?**

We are aware and we understand the challenges you encounter regarding
access, speed and quality of internet connectivity, let alone acquiring
it. It is for this reason that we are adopting ways of supporting your
access, use, and storage of the APC CoursePacks.

APC is providing you with everything you will need to study at your own
pace and in the comfort and safety of your homes.

1.  Home Study Assistance Credit to access APC CoursePacks

APC shall be crediting you with P1,000.00 (as APC’s Home Study
Assistance Credit) to your unpaid tuition this 3rd term or future
tuition. This will help you learn and complete your requirements
whatever the condition may be. Your desire for continuous learning
should not be a burden to you or your parents at this time.

2.  Some important information to get hold of your APC CoursePacks:

<!-- end list -->

1.  The APC CoursePacks will be available in MS Teams sites, arranged
    alphabetically per school.

2.  To get your required APC CoursePacks, simply join the Teams site.

3.  You are encouraged to download the APC CoursePacks of the courses
    you are enrolled in to reduce or limit your access to the internet.
    You may use different ways of storing the APC CoursePacks you need:

<!-- end list -->

  - Use the 16 Gb USB flash drive you were asked to prepare or in any
    storage device you have on hand.

  - If you cannot access the APC CoursePacks via the internet, please
    email coursepack@apc.edu.ph; indicate the format you want the
    CoursePacks in (electronic files stored in a USB drive or printed),
    your student number, name and complete address where the APC
    CoursePacks you need will be delivered. We will send the CoursePacks
    to you via courier service.

**How does the APC CoursePacks support Home Study?**

Now that you have the APC CoursePacks, you can now support your Home
Study needs. Here are some activities you will be able to accomplish for
the duration of your Home Study:

  - Download your APC CoursePacks, data or software

  - Collaborate with your teachers or classmates, not necessarily at the
    same time

  - Submit papers or projects

  - Access Linkedin Learning or YouTube videos as may be required

  - Access other Cloud-based systems or software

  - Store the APC CoursePacks, along with activities and submissions you
    performed, in a USB flash drive as proof of your participation and
    send it to your teacher in APC

  - Submit your proof of participation (hard copies) to your teacher in
    APC**How are student efforts and outputs assessed and graded?**

We all live in uncertain times. We realize that all our efforts are
encumbered with challenges. But despite that, your professors will
assess your performance based on the quality of submitted output, your
performance in assessments, likewise, the efforts you readily exerted to
participate in class in spite of the challenges. We will be adopting
only the following grading system:

1\. Having satisfactorily met the course requirement using
outcomes-based assessment as prescribed in the APC CoursePack, you will
be given:

a. 1.0 to 4.0 or 75 to 100: A numeric grade may be given if there are
substantial bases (e.g. class participation or effort, paper output,
written assessments, or project) to assess a student’s learning and
course outcomes; or b. Pass (P): as determined by your teacher.

2\. INC: A student may also be given a grade of ‘Incomplete (INC)’
should there be deficiencies in course requirements or the need for
reasonable time to comply. The student will be given one (1)
non-extendable academic year (AY 2020-2021) to comply with the course
requirements, for the ‘INC’ grade to be converted to a numerical or ‘P’
grade.

Under no circumstances will ‘No Grade (NG)’, ‘Repeat (R)’, ‘Fail (0.0)’
or a grade below 75 (for SHS) be given for all courses enrolled this 3rd
Term AY 2019-2020.

**What are other innovations in APC Enrolment Procedures and
Processes?**

In addition, we thought that it is prudent to further support you, our
students and their parents by way of relaxing existing APC procedures
and processes:

1.  A student may be allowed to re-enroll in a course within AY
    2020-2021 at no cost, as a refresher for his/her currently (3rd Term
    AY 2019-2020) enrolled course. This will be considered as either an
    ‘Audit’ or ‘Regular Course’.

2.  All pre-requisite courses enrolled for the current term will be
    considered as soft requisites. Thus, students will be allowed to
    proceed with enrollment to advanced courses for 1st Term AY
    2020-2021 even if grades on the soft requisites are still pending.
